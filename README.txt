Thank you for downloaning Crimzen!
Now, there is one more step to complete before you are ready to go
You need to take the Update Crimzen folder and move it one folder back
(Take the file and move it out of Crimzen-Client-main to wherever you put the folder when you got it)
Again, thanks for using our software
Thanks,
